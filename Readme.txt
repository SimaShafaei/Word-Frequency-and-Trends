I Chose Hamlet (one of Shekspearean Plays) as the script for next analysis. each act is saved in a seperate text file including:

ACT I in 'Hamlet ACT I.txt'
ACT II in 'Hamlet ACT II.txt'
ACT III in 'Hamlet ACT III.txt'
ACT IV in 'Hamlet ACT IV.txt'
ACT V in 'Hamlet ACT V.txt'

All above file are in Hamlet folder. So please keep this folder next to the 'CSE 532 Assignment 2.ipynb' file.

In the case of Spechial characters, I decided to romeve them and then analyze the text.

 
after analyzing the theme of each act with most repetitive words because 'will' is not determining the theme of the text and because 'Hamlet' is a word that appears almost uniformly in all acts I romoved these two words and evaluate the trend of acts without them again.
